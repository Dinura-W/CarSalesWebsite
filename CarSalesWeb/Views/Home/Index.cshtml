<!-- Holy moly this took me for ever but this pretty much lets index.cshtml know to recieve a list of Car objects from the controller
I first used the container type then the namespace then the class name for it to work !-->
@model List<CarSalesWeb.Models.Car>

    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";

<div class="text-center my-3">

    A form lets me user input speak into the server
    asp controller tells it which controller handles the request
    Also method get makes the query go into the url
-->
<form asp-controller="Home" method="get">
<!-- the name is the most important thing here as it makes the url have search appear in it -->
<input class="form-control text-dark py-3 shadow-sm" name="search" type="text" placeholder="Search To Find Your Dream Car Today...">

-->
<div class="row g-3">
@foreach (var car in Model)
{
